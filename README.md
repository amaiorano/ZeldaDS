# ZeldaDS

A Zelda game for the Nintendo DS in the style of the original Legend of Zelda for the NES.

Here's a not-so-great video of the game in action (via the excellent emulator [DeSmuME](http://desmume.org/)):

Here's a pretty good video of Zelous, the tile-based editor written in C#:

## History

I started working on this project in early 2010 because I wanted to make a game in a more constrained environment than PC. I owned a DS and a flash cart, so I figured it would be fun to make something I could actually play. Also, devkitPro, was (and still is) one of the best homebrew toolkits available, so the barrier to entry was low.

I spent much of my spare time working on ZeldaDS for about a year. During that time, I wrote the game engine and an editor (Zelous), and although they are not finished, they are quite far along. I eventually stopped developing the game due to my increased workload at my job.

Fast forward to 2014, with the ever increasing popularity of Github, I decided to open source my project so that others can perhaps learn from it, or maybe even continue working on it.


## Developer Setup

See [DEV_SETUP.md](DEV_SETUP.md) for information on how to setup your environment to develop ZeldaDS.
